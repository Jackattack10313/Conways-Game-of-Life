# Conway's Game of Life
JavaScript Conway's Game of Life using p5 and p5.clickable libraries. I learned from this project that oftentimes one of the hardest parts of trying something brand new to me is actually finding the tools / libraries that exist and are compatible to even make the project possible. I originally wanted to write in this program in cpp, but I could not get Ubuntu, VS Code, and SFML to all work on Windows 10. So instead I opted for JavaScript because I was already investigating creating a website. I learned I do not love some of the features of JavaScript, especially the lack of errors. I had an instance where I was calling my includes() function, and I switched my parameters accidentally. This created weird behavior that I was unable to pin down, especially without any errors. Any other language I have worked with before would have thrown an error for trying to call data members that are not defined like .length for the Position class.

How to run:
1. Open .html file (should open in your default browser)

or

1. Download VS Code && JavaScript Code Snippets / Live Server extensions
2. Open the folder in the explorer
3. Click "Go Live" in bottom right corner
